perform minimization automatically

Validate thermostat data (make sure all three wells are reached)
speed up PES evaluations

! check why torsion scan only returns .ex files (methyl rotation?)
!

classify dynamics data
build ML model


notes:
Only including .pt files so far seems to cause the PES to overestimate, especially compared against .ex files

Figure out why plots are off
    doesn't seem to be the md sampling
    (secondary plot has additional issue)
        error is off by about the same amount as the large displacement tests
