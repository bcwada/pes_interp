perform minimization automatically

Validate thermostat data (make sure all three wells are reached)
speed up PES evaluations


classify dynamics data
build ML model


notes:
- Even weighting parameter 250 suffers from a weighting problem. 250 is too close to an L_inf norm. 
One of the methyl rotations may not affect the largest distance and you can end up with equally weighted contributions

- The torsion is a little too perfectly spaced, and some of the torsion points look identical (across the mirror plane)



Figure out why plots are off
    doesn't seem to be the md sampling
    (secondary plot has additional issue)
        error is off by about the same amount as the large displacement tests
